    <h1>JavaScript Basic Challenges</h1>
    <h2>Challlenge 1</h2>
    <p>Add an h1 and h2 with that
        information. Then add a script tag before the closing
        body tag and between the script tags
        create two variables. Assign your first name to
        one and your last name to the other, then
        make JavaScript display the value of each
        variable in the console.</p>
    <h2>Challlenge 2</h2>
    <p>Use plus signs (+) and your two variables to
        write your first name and last name to the
        console on one line with a space between
        your names.</p>
    <h2>Challlenge 3</h2>
    <p>Add one more variable called "adjective" and
        assign it a value that describes you. Use the
        console to display a sentence that includes all
        three variables. This time use a template
        literal (tick marks, and ${} around variables).</p>
    <h2>Challlenge 4</h2>
    <p>In JavaScript, prompt() can be used like this:
        var name = prompt("what's your name?", "Bob");
        When the page loads a prompt will appear and the
        user can add some text. "Bob" is the default text. If you
        don't want default text, you can leave the second set of
        quotes empty.
        Write script that prompts the user for their name, and
        then display a sentence in the console that greets the
        user by name and welcomes them.</p>
    <h2>Challlenge 5</h2>
    <p>Update and save the file again, this time as
        challenge5.html
        This time, use prompt and ask the user for a
        whole number. If they type in a number less
        than 10, have the console log report, "You
        entered a number smaller than 10",
        otherwise, send "You entered a big number"
        to the console.</p>
    <h2>Challlenge 6</h2>
    <p>Notice in challenge 5, if a user types
        something other than a number, the console
        tells us they entered a big number. In this
        challenge, fix that so that if a user types
        something other than a number, the console
        displays a message that says there was an
        error.</p>
    <h2>Challlenge 7</h2>
    <p> if the user types a number
        less than 10, use a loop to print out the
        numbers from zero to 9 in the console.</p>
    <h2>Challlenge 8</h2>
    <p>For this challenge, if the user types a number
        less than 10, update the loop from the last
        challenge so that the console indicates the
        number the user entered.</p>
    <h2>Challlenge 9</h2>
    <p>Prompt the user for a color, then have the
        console report if the user typed a primary color
        (red, blue, or yellow) or a secondary color
        (orange, green or purple) or none of these.
        Handle the situation for both uppercase and
        lowercase letters in the color the user types in.
        Hint: remember the || means 'or'</p>

        if (color === 'red' || color === 'blue' || color === 'yellow') {
            console.log(`You picked a primary color: ${color} or ${color.toUpperCase()}`);
        } else if (color === 'orange' || color === 'green' || color === 'purple') {
            console.log(`You picked a secondary color: ${color} or ${color.toUpperCase()}`);
        } else {
            console.log(`You picked a color that is not primary or secondary: ${color} or ${color.toUpperCase}`);
