    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <h2>Challenge 10</h2>
    <p>Write a function called hello() that outputs a
        greeting in the console when the function
        runs.</p>
    <h2>Challenge 11</h2>
    <p> change hello() so that it
        takes a parameter, and when you run the
        function, you pass in the name of a person
        and the function outputs the greeting to the
        console.</p>
    <h2>Challenge 12</h2>
    <p>add a prompt requesting the user
        for their name, and assign the result to a
        variable.<br />
        Then pass that variable into the hello()
        function so that the console greets the person
        by name</p>
    <h2>Challenge 13</h2>
    </p>handle the situation that
    happens if the user clicks cancel on the
    prompt, or does not enter text in the prompt.
    If the user does one of those two actions,
    have the hello() function log to the console
    "You didn't give me your name". Otherwise,
    have the console log the greeting</p>
    <h2>Challenge 14</h2>
    <p>update the hello() function
        so that it returns a value rather than outputs
        directly to the console.
        I used a variable: var greeting; and returned
        that variable at the end of the function.
        Then outside the function write a call to the
        console that logs the greeting returned by the
        function.</p>
    <h2>Challenge 15</h2>
    <p>add an array of foods and
        put 3-5 elements in the array. Then make a
        new function called hospitality(); after the
        hello(); function.
        The new function will take two parameters, a
        name and a gift, which will be an array. Have
        this function run the hello() function and
        output the result to the console. Then have it
        loop through the gift array and offer a gift to
        the visitor by name and output that to the
        console.</p>
    <h2>Challenge 16</h2>
    <p>add the function that gets
        random integers from the functions lecture.
        Update the hospitality() function so that,
        instead of looping through the whole array,
        randomly picks one element from the array
        and offers that to the user.</p>
